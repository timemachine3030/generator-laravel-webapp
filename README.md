NOTE: This is not a Yeoman generator!!
========================

I hope that one day it becomes a Yeoman generator, but for now just grab
it and use it as a boilerplate.

## Things to take notice of:

 - The yeoman 'app' directory is called 'src' to avoid confusing it with
   the laravel 'app' directory.
 - `grunt server` uses the php 5.4 built-in server to help you develop,
   and includes livereload
 - `grunt build` creates a 'dist' directory with all your css and js
   optimized.


## TODO:

 - Test, I'm going to use this to develop a project start to finish and
   migrate any updates to this repo.
 - Make a real yeoman generator
 - Add php lint, mess detector, etc to `grunt`
